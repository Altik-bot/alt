  <p>My name is Altair. I’m 14 years old, and I’m passionate about technology, design, and web development. I spend a lot of time experimenting with HTML and CSS, building layouts, and exploring how websites and digital systems work. Sometimes I do it just for fun, sometimes to learn something new — but always because I’m curious.

I enjoy asking questions — not just to get answers, but to understand how things truly work. I’m interested in psychology, human behavior, and how people think. Reading helps me explore these areas, especially science fiction and meaningful stories.

I plan to study abroad in the future and get a high-quality education in IT. I’m working on my English, building projects, and always trying to grow. I believe that with focus and curiosity, there’s almost nothing you can’t learn
